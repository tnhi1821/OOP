**1. Operator overloading**: containing object-oriented programming exercises in Python focusing on operator overloading

**2. Library management**: Practice object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism. Implement classes to represent different types of books and their unique behaviors, leveraging inheritance to create a unified interface for managing and processing these books.

**3. The lifecycle of insects and amphibians**: Enhance understanding of inheritance and polymorphism in object-oriented programming. Create a base class for different types of animals and use inheritance to define specific behaviors for each species. Utilize polymorphism to handle varying life cycle patterns and development times, ensuring flexibility and scalability in the program.
